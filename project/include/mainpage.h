* **Extra Credit** 
This version does run on the extra credit files, including: multiple_drones.json, 
multiple_customers.json, multiple_packages.json, and multiple_deliveries.json \n


* **To obtain the code**, in the terminal, type:
<PRE> $ git clone https://github.umn.edu/umn-csci-3081-s21/repo-huynh365.git </PRE>
This will prompt you to sign in into your Github. If you have the right access, 
you would be able to obtain the code. To compile the code, navigate to the 
"repo-huynh365" directory that you just download from github by typing:
<PRE> $ cd repo-huynh365 </PRE>
**To compile the code**, in the terminal, type:
<PRE> $ make </PRE>
* **To run the simulation**, there are two ways: 
- If you are using **Docker**, after install all of the Docker software needed
for your environment, in directory "repo-huynh365", type the following commands 
to the terminal:
<PRE> $ bin/build-env.sh </PRE>
This will help build the docker image. To run docker image:
<PRE> bin/run-env.sh </PRE>
Build project web server (inside docker image), navigate to the "repo-huynh365"
directory, then:
<PRE> $ make </PRE>
To run the web server (inside docker image), inside "repo-huynh365" directory:
<PRE> $ ./bin/run.sh </PRE>
*
- If you are using **VOLE**, navigate to "repo-huynh365" directory, then 
<PRE> $ cd project </PRE>
<PRE> $ make </PRE>
<PRE> $ ./bin/run.sh </PRE>

- Note that the project is not designed to work on SSH yet \n

* **Dicussion of concrete factory pattern vs. abstract factory pattern vs. composite
factory pattern**

<CENTER>

</CENTER>

First, we begin with the concrete factory pattern. As we can see in Figure 1, there
is a new class call EntityFactory that is responsible for creating Entity. This prevents 
the program to have a lot of different Entity derived classes and to not know which one
would be created until runtime. This is good; however, there is still tight coupling. 
Everytime we have a new Entity derived class, we have to add new case/ new if else 
statement in EntityFactory. Here is how Abstract Factory come to the story. 

<CENTER>
\image html AF.png "Figure 2. Abstract Factory Pattern" 
</CENTER>

Figure 2 depicts how the UML of this program would look like if we employ Abstract 
Factory pattern. EntityFactory becomes an abstract class, pushing the creation of
each Entity derived class into subclasses. For example, Drone object is created by
DroneFactory. With this model, every time we create a new Entity derived class, we
just need to create a new subclass of EntityFactory. However, even with this pattern,
the CreateEntity function of DeliverySimulation still contains a thread of if-else
statement to decide which Entity to create. This is not idea, since every time we
add a new Entity derived class, we still have to edit our CreateEntity function in
DeliverySimulation. This is where Composite Factory Pattern helps.  

<CENTER>

</CENTER>

With the Composite Factory pattern, we can just create a CompositeFactory attribute
in DeliverSimulation class, then use that to link to the other attribute. This would
eliminate the long list of if and else statement anywhere in the code, and allow 
easy addition of new Entity derived as well as EntityFactory derived classes. 


* **Discussion about the composite factory pattern** implemented in the package 
delivery system:

So we have discussed about the advantage of Composite Factory Pattern in the previous
section. This pattern is excellent; however, it does have some disadvantages. The
most obvious cons of composite factory pattern is that it might be difficult to provide
a common interface for classes whose functionality differs too much. We might need 
to overgeneralize the componenent interface, making it harder to comprehend. In
addition, the cons from this package delivery simulation, the composite factory 
pattern requires more classes to be created. It is hard to see the relationship
between these classes even with a UML diagram. 

* **Designing and Implementing Strategy Pattern** <br>

In order to implement the strategy pattern in regards to choosing which route strategy 
for the drone to follow, we had to make several changes to our existing code. First, 
we had to create the interface which the concrete strategies would override. This abstract 
interface class is called RouteStrategy and it has the method GetRoute. We also have three 
concrete strategy classes; SmartRoute, BeelineRoute, and ParabolicRoute. These concrete 
classes inherit from RouteStrategy, and they implement the GetRoute method to their own 
specifications. Once we had this structure in place, we had to alter the drone and robot 
classes to extract the path type information from the json details. Once the constructor 
was aware of which type of path was specified, it would store a pointer to that class type 
in itâ€™s routeStrategy attribute. This way, when we are in the delivery simulation, we can 
call the GetRoute method from the routeStrategy attribute of the carrier. The default route 
is set to smart path, and for the robots, only smart path is implemented (as robots cannot 
fly).

<CENTER>

BeelineRoute, SmartRoute and ParabolicRoute"
</CENTER>

At first it was difficult to understand the strategy pattern for us, but after working 
through different examples in class and online (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strategy-pattern-set-2/), 
we were able to better apply the strategy pattern to our own code.

* **Designing and Implementing Different Route** <br>

Drones and Robots are carriers, where they can deliver from a source to the designated location. 
When a carrier moves, it notifies to all the observers the path of its current destination. 
Likewise, when a carrier stops moving, it also notifies all the observers. To go to the destination, 
there are three different route options that carriers can use, such as the SmartRoute, BeelineRoute, 
and ParabolicRoute, all of which are handled by RouteStrategy. However, the only strategy for the 
robots to deliver is the smart route since they cannot fly whereas the drones can use all three 
strategies since they are able to move in any 3D space (except buildings). The default strategy for 
the deliveries is the SmartRoute.

The **SmartRoute** uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path, which uses the IGraph::GetPath() 
function. This path allows both the robot and the drone to deliver on the specified "roads" without 
having to worry about colliding into buildings.

For the **BeelineRoute**, the only type of carrier that can use this beeline path is for the drone, 
where it flies up to a height of 400 from its source location. It then flies horizontally to its 
destination. Lastly, it flies down to the ground to reach the destination. The beeline route uses 
the height of 400 so it prevents the drones to not hit any building that crosses its path from one 
place to another.

For the last strategy, **ParabolicRoute,** only the drones can use the parabolic path where it 
followed by a smooth projectile curve. The calculation is as follows:

<PRE>
y = (1 - distance(V, Vm)^2 / distance(Vo, Vm)^2) * j (2), where

Vo is our source point
V is the point we are moving to
Vm is our midpoint equal to distance(source, destination) / 2
T is the number of steps we are estimating
Vt is our step interval equal to distance(source, destination) / T
j is a tuning parameter that we can use to avoid building collision and scale the parabola's slope
